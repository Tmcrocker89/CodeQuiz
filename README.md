This is my CodeQuiz game, when you hit the start button a 75 second timer is started. you have 75 seconds to answer 4 questions. If you miss a question 10 seconds is deducted from your time left, once you answer all 4 questions, or the time reaches 0 you can store your score and view it on the highscore page. you can also clear your scores.
